## Introduction

`keepalive-react-router` is a route-level keepalive solution for `react-router`. It provides a way to cache the component instance when the route is switched, and reuse it when the route is switched back.

## Features

- Route level keepalive based on React Router DataAPI
- Route transition animation support
- Scroll position restoration for keepalive route components
- Excellent performance: keepalive route components do not enter the react rendering process
- Easy to use: one component to rule them all
- Flexible control: provide API to control route cache and lifecycle
